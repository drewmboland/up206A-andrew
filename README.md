I am a first-year MURP student pursuing a certificate in Urban Design & Mobility. I would love to work in a field that intersects design and policy to improve the quality of life in global cities; in short, I hope to work at a firm that designs cities of the future, developing systems/neighborhoods that accentuate the positives and ameliorate the ills of modern urban life. I have no prior Python or GIS experience, though I recognize that knowledge of these is useful in many careers in Urban Planning. I enrolled in this course so that, by its conclusion, I can have a working foundational knowledge in Python, data science, GIS, etc that will help me in my future career. I don't have a specific project idea that I bring to the course (perhaps this is something that this course will inspire), though I am interested in how data science and technology can be used to better understand urban populations.
